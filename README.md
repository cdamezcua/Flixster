### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs did prepare me to complete the assignment. The concepts and techniques covered in the labs provided a solid foundation for building the necessary features in my weekly assignment.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Instead of using emojis, I would have used icons to represent various elements or actions in the project. Icons can provide a more consistent and professional visual representation. Also, I would have added a carousel or a slider to display multiple videos related to the movie in the pop-up dialog. This would allow users to easily browse and view different video options without leaving the dialog.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went well overall. The basic functionality of displaying movie information and allowing users to search and view movie details was successfully demonstrated. During the project demo, I received feedback from the teacher that highlighted a strange behavior in the search functionality. This feedback was valuable as it helped me identify an issue that needed to be addressed. I took the feedback and worked on correcting the problem.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

I want to express my sincere appreciation to Tim Lee for his tremendous help and valuable feedback throughout the project.
